# Automation-of-Uptime-Kuma-setup-
This repository provides a fully automated setup for deploying Uptime Kuma without Docker on an Ubuntu-based server. It includes a Bash script that installs dependencies, sets up Uptime Kuma, configures it as a systemd service, and ensures it runs automatically after system reboots.
